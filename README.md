 Hi, Iâ€™m John Britton and welcome to my profile!

I am a full stack developer based in Denver, Colorado. I am a leader and a team player, with excellent communication skills and a dedication to producing high-quality work.

Before entering the tech industry, I gained valuable experience in the construction and warehouse sectors. These roles taught me the importance of hard work and attention to detail, skills that I have carried with me into my current career.

As a full stack developer, I am proficient in a range of technologies and frameworks, including React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I am always looking to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.

Thank you for visiting my profile. If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,  
The Denver Polar Bear
